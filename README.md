# Text Mining Project - NLI

Natural Language Inferencing (NLI) on Texts from different languages.
Detect semantic entailment and contradictions. 

## Abstract

The goal of this project was to explore different methods of natural language processing and investigate how they compare on a small and challenging dataset in the task of natural language inference (NLI). We investigate different methods and see how they perform in this scenario.  We explore simpler methods of neural networks trained with manual features as well as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks and finally transformer architectures. We also explore the topic of pretraining in this context since the used dataset is relatively small. Another challenging aspect of the dataset is that it does not only contain English samples but samples from 15 different languages. We tackle this problem both by using translation as well as multi-lingual models and compare both approaches.
